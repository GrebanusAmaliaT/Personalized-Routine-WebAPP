- `ASP.NET MVC` for app structure and backend logic
- `SQL Server` for user data and routines storage
- `JavaScript` (vanilla) for interactivity, notifications, and toggles

- `HTML5` + layout grid system for modern responsive design
- `LocalStorage` and `setTimeout` / `setInterval` for routine reminders
